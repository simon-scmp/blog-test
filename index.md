## Welcome to my personal GitHub Pages

### Updating…

May 2022. Updating and coming back to GitHub Pages afer leaving for a while. I've been looking at all the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org) possibilities. Using [Netlify](https://netlify.com) for deployment over GitHub Pages. Also looking at [publii](https://getpublii.com) using as headless CMS then directing to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) or working with **Render**


#### This was to have started out as a [**Grav**](https://getgrav.org) site!

There are several similarities between **Grav** and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}

- They both use [YAML](https://yaml.org/){:target="_blank"} Frontmatter.
- They both claim to serve up fast lightweight static web Pages.
- Grav uses [PHP](https://www.php.net/){:target="_blank"}
- Jekyll uses [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/){:target="_blank"}
- The standard format for writing pages is [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/){:target="_blank"}
- Grav uses [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/){:target="_blank"} templating system.
- Jekyll uses [Liquid](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/){:target="_blank"} from Shopify.

##### However…

Pages served up from GitHub are free as part of the GitHub account but if you want to use Grav it needs a fairly traditional ISP host with PHP running which is a cost option and I've run into issues with permissions on uploading to the /www folder especially on Debian.

#### Grav features

However, Grav doesn't seem to have (pun) a lot of gravity behind it. I'm not seeing much evidence of widespread.
