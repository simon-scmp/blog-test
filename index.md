## Welcome to GitHub Pages

#### This was to have started out as a [**Grav**](https://getgrav.org) site!

There are several similarities between **Grav** and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

- They both use [YAML](https://yaml.org/) Frontmatter.
- They both claim to serve up fast lightweight static web Pages.
- Grav uses PHP
- Jekyll uses [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
- The standard format for writing pages is [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

##### Howeverâ€¦

Pages served up from GitHub are free as part of the GitHub account but if you want to use Grav it needs a fairly traditional ISP host with PHP running which is a cost option and I've run into issues with permissions on uploading to the /www folder especially on Debian.
